# Data-Science-from-A-to-Z-in-30-Days (15-Chapters Edition)

This repository documents my intensive **15-day intensive Data Science challenge** based on *Data Science from Scratch (2nd Edition, O'Reilly)* by Joel Grus. Each chapter is thoroughly explained with practical tutorials and followed by professional-level project challenges designed to be completed within 3 hours each.

Due to the original book containing 24 chapters, I have restructured the material into **15 core chapters**, carefully selecting the most essential topics to provide a comprehensive and practical understanding of data science.

The primary goal is to develop job-ready data science skills, strengthen theoretical understanding, and build a robust portfolio.
